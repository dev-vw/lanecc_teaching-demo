# Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

In my courses, I strive to foster an inclusive learning environment for all my students. Specifically, I've adopted and embraced the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) followed by the [Carpentries Project](https://carpentries.org/):

> We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by The Carpentriesâ€™ Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form of behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:
> - Use welcoming and inclusive language
> - Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
> - Gracefully accept constructive criticism
> - Focus on what is best for the community
> - Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
