# **R Spatial Tools for Social Science**

This is the homepage for the **R Spatial Tools for Social Science** course. At the end of this ten-week course, students will

1. understand how to systematically apply geographical principles towards a wide breadth of social science research questions.
2. acquire competency in using the R programming language to clean and manipulate spatial data.
3. understand how to run spatial models, interpret the results, and present the findings to their peers.

**Please refer to individual lesson pages for specific learning materials and tutorials.**

## Premilinaries

Given the unique challenges that students face in an online learning environment, I have aimed to make this course as interactive as possible. Each week will progressively advance your skills within the R programming environment. No prior R knowledge is assumed, but given diligent learning and attendance of the course sessions, R competency will be expected by the end of the quarter.

#### How to ask for help during class

The weekly classes will be tutorial based, and I will be live-coding over Zoom. This means that I will be guiding the class through the week's programming objective, by following the steps outlined in each week's lesson. During the class, I will conduct regular check-ins with the class, using the "reactions" feature of the Zoom interface. When queried, please react with a red x if you have any questions or issues. If you don't have questions or issues, please react with a green checkmark.

##  Downloading R and RStudio

This course requires that you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your personal computer. **R** is an open-source programming language and environment uniquely capable of hosting statistical computing and graphics. **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) that uses **R** to develop and create statistical programs. Although there are many IDEs that support R programming and interaction (e.g. emacs, vim, etc.), we will be using RStudio in this course: it is a powerful, versatile, freely available, and commonly used application across academic research and the data science industry. 

**Please access the following links to download and install R and RStudio for your operating system.** All common operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux) should be able to host R and RStudio. Please contact me by email ASAP if you are having any trouble with installation.
