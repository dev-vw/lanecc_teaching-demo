This is the homepage for the **R Spatial Tools for Social Science** course. At the end of this ten-week course, students will

1. understand how to systematically apply geographical principles towards a wide breadth of social science research questions.
2. acquire competency in using the R programming language to clean and manipulate spatial data.
3. understand how to run spatial models, interpret the results, and present the findings to their peers.

**Please refer to individual lesson pages for specific learning materials and tutorials.**

## Premilinaries

Given the unique challenges that students face in an online learning environment, I have aimed to make this course as interactive as possible. Each week will progressively advance your skills within the R programming environment. No prior R knowledge is assumed, but given diligent learning and attendance of the course sessions, R competency will be expected by the end of the quarter.

#### How to ask for help during class

The weekly classes will be tutorial based, and I will be live-coding over Zoom. This means that I will be guiding the class through the week's programming objective, by following the steps outlined in each week's lesson. During the class, I will conduct regular check-ins with the class, using the "reactions" feature of the Zoom interface. When queried, please react with a <span style ="color:red">red x</span> if you have any questions or issues. If you don't have questions or issues, please react with a <span style="color:green">green checkmark</span>:

#### Shared lesson notes

During each lesson, a live Google Doc will be shared amongst the class. I will use this space to include any errata or corrections to the lesson notes, insert links towards helpful resources mentioned during class, etc. Additionally, any in-class exercises will be posted under the **Lesson Activities** heading.

*You are encouraged to interact with this document.* Please contribute questions under the **Student Questions** header. If you have thoughts about the lesson, please feel free to comment under the **Comments** header. Each week's shared lesson notes can be accessed through the course schedule.

##  Downloading R and RStudio

This course requires that you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your personal computer. **R** is an open-source programming language and environment uniquely capable of hosting statistical computing and graphics. **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) that uses **R** to develop and create statistical programs. Although there are many IDEs that support R programming and interaction (e.g. emacs, vim, etc.), we will be using RStudio in this course: it is a powerful, versatile, freely available, and commonly used application across academic research and the data science industry. 

**Please access the following links to download and install R and RStudio for your operating system.** All common operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux) should be able to host R and RStudio. Please contact me by email ASAP if you are having any trouble with installation.

## About your instructor

My name is Vania and I'm a fifth year PhD candidate in geography at UC Santa Barbara. Although my degrees are in public health and infectious disease, most of my work is interdisciplinary and focused on incorporating computational techniques in public health research.
