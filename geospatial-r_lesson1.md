## Lesson objectives

- Gain familiarity with RStudio workspace.
- Begin executing basic computational operations within the R console.
- Understand the difference between **vector** and **raster** datasets.
- Import vector data into R using the `sf` package.
- Plot the vector data into R using the `ggplot2` package.

## Preliminaries

#### Navigating the RStudio workspace

#### Installing and loading R packages

Please make sure to have `ggplot2`, `sf`, and `ggmap` installed. You can do this by typing the following into the R console.

```
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "sf", "ggmap"))
```

After installation completes, load the packages into your R workspace:

```
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(ggmap)
```
